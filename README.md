# Analyse Open Microscopy Data in MATLAB

A MATLAB Live Script with accompanying Jupyter Notebook to access and use Microscopy image data sets from the Open Microscopy database

## Getting started

This is a tutorial for biologists demonstrating the use of MATLAB to access free microscopy data from the Open Microscopy database.
The tutorial covers the following steps
- Access a list of openly available projects on Open Microscopy
- Query and inspect the metadata associated with these projects using commands directly from MATLAB (RESTful API)
- Access specific data from within the database directly, avoiding time-consuming downloads of large data
- Analyse the microscopy images to identify cells
- Pubish the results on GitHub and make them accessible using Open With MATLAB Online

**Note**
This tutorial works best when delivered by a tutor. It is important to highlight best practices when working with Open Data, publishing Open Code or making research output reproducible
