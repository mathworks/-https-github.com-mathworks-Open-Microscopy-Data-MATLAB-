## About the Image Data Resource
The Image Data Resource (IDR) is a public repository of image datasets from published scientific studies, where the community can submit, search and access high-quality bio-image data.
It can be accessed at [https://idr.openmicroscopy.org/](https://idr.openmicroscopy.org/)

**For advanced users** A detailed guide to the Image Data Resource can be found [here](idr.openmicroscopy.org/about/api.html). To access the REST API use the MATLAB [webread](mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/webread.html) function

### Required Products
This tutorial uses the following products /n
